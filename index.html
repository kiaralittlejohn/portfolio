           This is meant to be a simple way to<br>

           Most of my designs are simple, <br>
           as they were made in a <br>

                  These scenes were made for a virtual reality game called "Mundo de las Matemáticas". A game meant to teach kids fractions. These were created using Unreal Engine 5.<br>
                  <i>Through this experience I learned to mount scenes that were both visually entertaining and could capture the player's attention.</i><br>

              I wanted a cool template for my instagram stories so that I could share what song I was listening to at the moment.
              And came up with this little 3D mp3 type of gadget that shows the song, the lyrics, an equalizer and a cool cat with headphones.<br>
              <i>I believe this project is one of my best as it is something unique and shows my ability to use various animation and shading tools in Blender.</i>

              These are examples of environments and props I have created both in 3D and 2D. I wasn't initially drawn to designing spaces, 
              but I then realized with time that I somewhat had a knack for lighting, composition and perspective. My interest peaked when 
              I started handling Unity and Unreal. <br>
              <i>My goal was to be able to capture different emotions through my scenes and objects.</i></p>

              <h2>Character Design</h2>
                <p>There was an assignment where I had to create a storyboard based on a random setting given to me. I was given the words 
                "Forest", "Large vehicle" and "Fishing". I was inspired by a video I saw online of a FedEx worker taking a break fishing 
                in a pond. I wanted to localize it, making the story resonate with a more Chilean audience and took inspiration from 
                Chilean package delivery. I wanted the story to feel like a commercial with cute and fantastical elements. And so I 
                designed a character ispired by the Chilean myth of the Tue Tue, with a cuter spin to it.<br>
                <i>Through this lesson I learned about composition and shading in storyboarding to create an attractive story with no dialogue.</i></p>

                I was once asked to pick a videogame that was developed in a different country, I chose Disco Elysium from Estonia. 
                After investigating Estonian culture's influence on the game, I designed a character inspired by Chilean culture that could fit in the game's universe. I designed a character 
                influenced by "Los Jaivas", a Chilean progressive rock band. I believe this fit the game's Estonian culture and message. <br>
                <i>Through this experience, I learned to create new game narratives to an already existing story.</i></p>

                Here are some exercises I did to design characters in different styles. <br>
                <i>I tend to adapt my style between more realistic or stylistic 
                depending on what the project needs.</i> <br>
                I hope that, as I progress and gain more experience, I might find my niche so that I can create a 
                style of character that is true to me.</p>

                  cheerful facade of "Kitty-Chat!" unravels into a corrupted nightmare. Your choices in interactive chats shape the 
                  story’s ending, exploring themes of online friendship and digital decay. 
                  <br>
                  Our team set out to create a 2D existential horror game with a diegetic UI—where the interface is integral to gameplay. 
                  After much brainstorming, I proposed "Kitty-Chat!", inspired by the nostalgia of games like Club Penguin but reimagined 
                  through a darker lens. As the world collapses and the player struggles to preserve fading childhood memories, "Kitty-Chat!" 
                  becomes a haunting reflection on the loss of innocence and the impermanence of digital worlds.

                <h2>UI/UX Design</h2>
                <p>
                  I took inspiration from my favourite 2000s games for the designs. I used blended shading for the game UI to give it a more early 3D feel. 
                  Meanwhile for the moderator windows and buttons, I went for a more sober, minimalist design to contrast, inspired by WindowsXP.

                <h2>Sound Design</h2>
                <p>
                  There were a lot of different types of music in the late 2000s to early 2010s. So it was hard to create a specific sound 
                  that felt like it was from that time. I focused on trying find which genres were most fondly remembered by people 
                  growing up on the early internet, and which instruments/sounds they were most likely to have. So that I could then 
                  try to copy the styles. I didn't want the music to sound like it was made today. 
                </p>

                <h2>Concept Art</h2>
                <p>
                For the character concepts it was integral to keep the designs as simplistic as possible while making sure they all had 
                their own individuality. I was unsure of what each character's personality was going to be like, and so I came up with an 
                array of different costumes inspired by the ones kids were most likely to wear in online worlds.</p>

                For the different locations inside of Kitty Chat, I really wanted them to be places that are hard to find today. 
                Spaces that once held a lot of meaning to us in the past but are now long forgotten or are dying due to changing times. 
                Places like diners, arcades, blockbusters. Places that are engraved in our hearts but are no more than memories, which is 
                what forgotten worlds like Kitty Chat truly represent.</p>

                <p>My First (and Last) Carrete promises a chaotic, stressful, yet funny 15-minute journey that captures the essence of an  
                  unforgettable (and perhaps regrettable) night out.<br>

                  The game plunges you into the vibrant, very different, world of a Chilean "carrete" (party) through the eyes of Alex, a Chilean 
                  who's spent five years in Canada and is now struggling to reconnect with his roots. This specific cultural setting, with its distinct 
                  social dynamics and regional slang, creates an authentic parody of a coming of age story in Chilean life. 
                  <br><br>
                  Our university professors had asked to create a game based on our personal experiences. That is when came up with My First and Last Carrete.
                  It is based on my experience going to Chilean parties as a young adult after spending my teenage years in Canada. 
                  The differences in language and cultures led to some very awkward and uncomfortable scenarios. This was due to my peers having 
                  matured in an environment which was completely different to mine.

                <h2>Characters</h2>
                <p>
                  To create the characters, I had to conduct research to understand the types of people who attend 'carretes' (parties). 
                  I interviewed 13 individuals: 
                  10 from different regions, 7 women, and 6 men, all between 19-28 years old. 
                  They shared their funniest party anecdotes and described the characteristics of the people they knew. Each character in the game represents a Chilean youth stereotype with their respective slang, accents, and behaviours.

                <p>
                  The game features chiptune covers of songs that are popular in Chile, those typically played for diverse groups. 
                  However, my music skills at that time weren't what they are now. I had no idea about music theory, and the resulting covers were 
                  completely out of sync. Surprisingly, everyone who played the game <b>LOVED</b> the music. Listening to it caused most people 
                  to chuckle or to even burst out laughing. It was well-received as the essence of a 'carrete' could still be conveyed even with 
                  the chiptune style, and the off-beat notes added more humor to the experience.

            Hello! I’m Kiara. I'm a Canadian game designer and artist living
            in Santiago, Chile. I am currently in my final year studying
            Digital Game Design at Andrés Bello University.
            Upon finishing, I will be eager to specialize in creating
            3D assets and environments. This will allow me to further develop
            my skills to work at a company where I can create and build
            lasting relationships. My professional goal is to add
            value to a company through my creative thinking skills,
            ability to work under pressure, and teamwork.
