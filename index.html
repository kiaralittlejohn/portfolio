           This is meant to be a simple way to<br>
           access my best work from university.<br>
           Most of my designs took<br>
           1-2 days to finish.</p>

                  These scenes were made for a virtual reality game meant to teach kids fractions. These were created using Unreal Engine 5.<br>

              I wanted a cool template for my instagram stories so that I could share what song I was listening to at the moment.<br>
              And came up with this little 3D mp3 type of gadget that shows the song, the lyrics, an equalizer and a cool cat with headphones!<br>
              Modelled and animated in Blender.</p>

              These are examples of environments and props I have created both in 3D and 2D. I wasn't initially drawn to designing spaces,<br>
              but I then realized with time that I somewhat had a knack for lighting, composition and perspective. My interest peaked when <br>
              I started handling Unity and Unreal. My goal was to be able to capture different emotions and tell stories through my scenes and objects.</p>

              <h1>My Art</h1>  
              <h2>Character Design</h2>
                <p>There was an assignment where I had to create a storyboard based on a random setting given to me. I was given the words:<br>
                "Forest", "Large vehicle" and "Fishing". I was inspired by a video I saw online of a FedEx worker taking a break fishing<br>
                in a pond. I wanted to localize it, making the story resonate with a more Chilean audience and took inspiration from<br>
                Chilean package delivery. I wanted the story to feel like a commercial with cute and fantastical elements. And so I<br>
                designed a character ispired by the Chilean myth of the Tue Tue, with a cuter spin to it.</p>
                <div class="image-grid">

                <p><br>
                For this assignment I had to pick a videogame that was developed in a different country, I chose Disco Elysium from Estonia.<br>
                I was then asked to design a character inspired by Chilean culture that could fit in the game's universe. I designed a character<br> 
                influenced by "Los Jaivas", a Chilean progressive rock band. I believe this fit the game's Estonian culture and message.</p>

                <p><br>
                Here are some exercises I did to design characters in different styles. I tend to adapt my style between more realistic or stylistic<br>
                depending on what the project needs. I hope that, as I progress and gain more experience, I might find my niche so that I create a<br>
                style of character that is true to me.</p>

                  <p>Step into the unsettling world of "Kitty-Chat!", a psychological horror narrative and 2D simulation puzzle game. <br>
                  As a moderator in a once-thriving virtual community, you must preserve its crumbling reality while facing mysterious <br>
                  glitches and eerie distortions. Engage in dynamic conversations, solve complex puzzles, and ban rogue bots as the <br>
                  cheerful facade of "Kitty-Chat!" unravels into a corrupted nightmare. Your choices in interactive chats shape the <br>
                  story’s ending, exploring themes of online friendship and digital decay.<br>
                  <br>
                  Our team set out to create a 2D existential horror game with a diegetic UI—where the interface is integral to gameplay. <br>
                  After much brainstorming, I proposed "Kitty-Chat!", inspired by the nostalgia of games like Club Penguin but reimagined <br>
                  through a darker lens. As the world collapses and the player struggles to preserve fading childhood memories, "Kitty-Chat!" <br>
                  becomes a haunting reflection on the loss of innocence and the impermanence of digital worlds.
                  <br><br></p>
                <h2>UI/UX Design</h2>
                <p>
                  I took inspiration from my favourite 2000s games for the designs. I used blended shading for the game UI to give it a more early 3D feel.<br>
                  Meanwhile for the moderator windows and buttons, I went for a more sober, minimalist design to contrast, inspired by WindowsXP.

                <h2>Sound Design</h2>
                <p>
                  There were a lot of different types of music in the late 2000s to early 2010s. So it was hard to create a specific sound<br>
                  that felt like it was from that time. I focused on trying find which genres were most fondly remembered by people<br>
                  growing up on the early internet, and which instruments/sounds they were most likely to have. So that I could then<br>
                  try to copy the styles. I didn't want the music to sound like it was made today.

                For the character concepts it was integral to keep the designs as simplistic as possible while making sure they all had<br>
                their own individuality. I was unsure of what each character's personality was going to be like, and so I came up with an<br>
                array of different costumes inspired by the ones kids were most likely to wear in online worlds.</p>

                  <p>My First (and Last) Carrete promises a chaotic, stressful, yet undeniably funny 15-minute journey that captures the essence of an<br> 
                  unforgettable (and perhaps regrettable) night out.<br>

                  The game plunges you into the vibrant, very different, world of a Chilean "carrete" (party) through the eyes of Alex, a Chilean <br>
                  who's spent five years in Canada and is now struggling to reconnect with his roots. This specific cultural setting, with its distinct <br>
                  social dynamics and regional slang, creates an authentic parody of a coming of age story in Chilean life.<br>
                  <br><br>
                  Our university professors had asked to create a game based on our personal experiences. That is when came up with My First and Last Carrete.
                  It is based on my experience going to Chilean parties as a young adult after spending my teenage years in Canada.<br>
                  The differences in language and cultures led to some very awkward and uncomfortable scenarios. This was due to my peers having<br>
                  matured in an environment which was completely different to mine.<br>

            Hello! I’m Kiara. I'm a Canadian game designer and artist living
            in Santiago, Chile. I am currently in my final year studying
            Digital Game Design at Andrés Bello University.
            Upon finishing, I will be eager to specialize in creating
            3D assets and environments. This will allow me to further develop
            my skills to work at a company where I can create and build
            lasting relationships. My professional goal is to add
            value to a company through my creative thinking skills,
            ability to work under pressure, and teamwork.
